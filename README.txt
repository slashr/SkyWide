Changing The Scrolling Background:

This relies entirely on CSS to do its thing, which is cool, but that makes changing it a bit weird/tricky at first. You can still use pretty much any image you want, but for best results make sure yours is:

	- Horizontally tileable.
	- Wide and short.
	- About 1500px wide.
	- Fades to a solid color either at the top of bottom (which is used to fill the empty space above or below your image).

In CSS,	look for this line in css/style.css (line 108 as of this writing):
	background: #348cb2 url("images/bg.jpg") bottom left;
and use it to set the page background color, URL, and placement of your image. It should be as close to 1500px wide as you can get it.
